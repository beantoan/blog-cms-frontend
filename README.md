- Run command `npm install` to install the requirements
- Run command `npm run start` to compile and start the project
- Open the browser on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)
- Sure that there is no running program which occupied port 4200. If it exists, please append `--port 1234 --disable-host-check` into value of attribute `start` in file `package.json`.
